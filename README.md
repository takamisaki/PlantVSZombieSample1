# Usage

1. This project has already contained `cocos2d` framework, so you do not need to install any other framework to run it.

2. Download the whole zip file and unzip it, this project is only implemented by Xcode on Mac, so please make sure you have installed Xcode on your Mac.

3. Then you have to open folder `proj.ios_mac` and then open the `pvz001.xcodeproj` by Xcode, and then press **command + R** to test it. Thanks for your idea :D
